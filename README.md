Reflow Markdown
===============

Reflow Markdown is a Visual Studio Code Extension originally forked from the [Reflow paragraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TroelsDamgaard.reflow-paragraph)
extension by [Troels Damgaard](https://github.com/dontrolle/vscode-reflow-lines).
Instead of targeting any line of text, however it focuses on Markdown files
only and the specific formatting constructs unique to it such as paragraphs,
headings, block quotes, lists, and code blocks.

Format the current heading, paragraph, list, or blockquote to have lines no
longer than your preferred line length, using the `alt+q` shortcut or your own
user-specific keyboard-binding.

This extension defaults to reflowing lines to be no more than 80 characters
long. The preferred line length may be overridden using the config value of
`reflowMarkdown.preferredLineLength`.

By default, it preserves the indent for paragraphs, when reflowing. This
behavior may be switched off, by setting the configuration option
`reflowMarkdown.preserveIndent` to `false`.

Extension Settings
------------------

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `reflowMarkdown.preferredLineLength`: Set the preferred line length for
  reflowing paragraph (default: `80`).

- `reflowMarkdown.preserveIndent`: Preserve paragraph indent when reflowing
  paragraph (default `true`).

- `reflowMarkdown.doubleSpaceBetweenSentences`: Insert two spaces instead of
  one between each sentence (default `false`).

Keyboard Shortcuts

- Invoke a reflow using `alt+q` (default).
